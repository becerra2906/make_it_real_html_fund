            Our Story
        </h2>
        <p>
            We are an independent coffee roasting company based in downtown Toronto. We specialise on single origin, small batch roasting, aiming to create the best possible cupping experience money can buy. We were set up by two colombian brothers who after living
            away from home for years, wanted a place where they could buy coffee with the standard and the knowledge expected by someone who grew in a country where coffee is <strong>everything</strong>.
